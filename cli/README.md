# CLI Panda - Python CLI Component

This directory contains the original Python CLI implementation of CLI Panda.

## Overview

`cli_panda.py` is the standalone Python script that provides AI-powered terminal assistance using LM Studio's REST API. It was the first implementation before the TypeScript version in `ai-terminal/`.

## Features

- Direct integration with LM Studio REST API
- Context-aware terminal assistance
- Command suggestions and explanations
- Polish locale support
- Colorful terminal output

## Usage

```bash
# Run directly
python cli/cli_panda.py --help

# Or if installed via pip/uv
cli-panda --help
```

## Future Integrations

The script includes placeholders for future integrations:
- MCP Memory Server for long-term memory
- ChromaDB vector database for semantic search
- RAMLake for distributed memory management
- KV-Cache optimization for efficiency

## Relationship to Other Components

- **ai-terminal/**: The newer TypeScript implementation with more features
- **lbrxchat/**: RAG system that can be integrated for document analysis
- **PostDevAI/**: Distributed memory system for persistent context

This Python CLI serves as a lightweight alternative and testing ground for new features before they're implemented in the main TypeScript version.
