## Phase 4: Integration and Testing

### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Create integration test suite
- [ ] Add benchmark tests for performance
- [ ] Implement stress tests for memory management
- [ ] Add security tests

### Optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize critical paths
- [ ] Fine-tune memory management
- [ ] Optimize communication protocols
- [ ] Reduce latency in common operations

### Documentation
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Create user guides
- [ ] Add developer documentation
- [ ] Create API references

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Core Functionality First**: Focus on completing the RAM-Lake implementation and MLX model manager, as these are the foundation for everything else.
2. **Vertical Slices**: Implement small end-to-end features rather than building entire layers at once.
3. **Testability**: Ensure each component is testable in isolation.
4. **Performance**: Maintain focus on high performance and low latency throughout development.
5. **Security**: Incorporate security considerations from the beginning.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the RAM-Lake implementation, focusing on the remaining store implementations.
2. Develop the gRPC protocol definitions for inter-node communication.
3. Enhance the TUI with full implementation of all views.
4. Create the monitoring system for the Developer Node.
5. Begin implementing the Coordinator Node components.

## Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1: 4-6 weeks
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 3: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks

Total estimated time: 12-17 weeks
