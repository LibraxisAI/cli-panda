# Autonomy-Run Philosophy

PostDevAI embodies a new paradigm of developer tooling called "Autonomy-Run," where the system proactively monitors, analyzes, and assists development without requiring explicit invocation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Ambient Intelligence

PostDevAI runs continuously in the background, monitoring all development activities. It builds a comprehensive understanding of:

- Your coding patterns and preferences
- Common issues you encounter
- Your problem-solving approaches
- Project structure and architecture

Unlike traditional tools that require explicit invocation, PostDevAI is always observing, learning, and ready to assist at the moment of need.

### 2. Zero-Friction Intervention

Traditional tools create friction by requiring you to:
- Stop what you're doing
- Formulate a clear question
- Wait for a response
- Interpret and apply the response

PostDevAI eliminates this friction by:
- Detecting issues automatically (e.g., build failures, runtime errors)
- Understanding the context without explanation
- Proposing solutions in the appropriate context
- Often implementing fixes autonomously

### 3. Human-AI Dev Loop

```yaml
workflow:
  name: human_ai_dev_loop
  description: >-
    Iterative loop where a human tester interacts with running application; AI agent observes
    terminal logs, proposes fixes, applies changes, restarts app. Repeat until production ready.

steps:
  - id: start_server
    actor: AI
    command_examples:
      - "pnpm dev | cat"
      - "cargo run --release | cat"
    notes: Pipe to cat to avoid pager; stay idle after start.

  - id: manual_testing
    actor: Human
    action: "Interact with UI/API; generate runtime/build logs"
    finish_signal: "Ctrl-C in terminal"

  - id: log_analysis
    actor: AI
    tasks:
      - parse_stdout_stderr
      - classify_errors: [build, runtime, env, spam]
      - draft_fix_plan: max_items: 6

  - id: discussion
    actors: [Human, AI]
    decisions:
      - accept_plan
      - modify_plan
      - defer_item

  - id: implementation
    actor: AI
    substeps:
      - code_edits_atomic
      - env_updates
      - dependency_installs
      - restart_server (loop to start_server)

rules:
  logging:
    long_process: "use | cat or is_background true"
    suppress_spam: true
  env_handling:
    auto_fix_if_missing: true
  linter_errors:
    quick_fix: true
  big_refactor:
    separate_task: true

agi_perspective:
  ethos: "symbiosis, zero_ego, data_driven, rapid_value"
  learning: "each loop adds to org memory"
  goal: "minimize human cognitive load on plumbing; maximize creative input"
```

This workflow allows for a symbiotic relationship where:
- You focus on creative aspects and high-level decisions
- PostDevAI handles the mundane, repetitive, and technical details
- Decisions remain in your control, with implementation automated

### 4. Contextual Absolute Memory

Where traditional tools have limited context, PostDevAI maintains:

- Complete history of your development activities
- Semantic understanding of code evolution
- Memory of past issues and solutions
- Cross-project knowledge transfer

This "contextual absolute memory" means PostDevAI can recall:
- "You encountered a similar issue in project X three months ago"
- "This pattern resembles something you implemented last year"
- "You typically solve this problem using approach Y"

### 5. Transparent Operation

Despite its autonomous nature, PostDevAI maintains transparency:

- TUI interface shows exactly what it's monitoring
- Clear explanation for interventions
- Easily accessible logs of all actions
- Configurable autonomy levels

## Implementation Approach

PostDevAI implements Autonomy-Run through:

1. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Terminal output capture
   - File system change observation
   - IDE integration (if available)
   - Git operations monitoring

2. **Event Detection:**
   - Error pattern recognition
   - Build failure analysis
   - Runtime exception detection
   - Performance anomaly identification

3. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - Past similar issues retrieval
   - Project-specific pattern matching
   - Developer preference consideration
   - Solution effectiveness prediction

4. **Intervention Spectrum:**
   - Passive logging (lowest autonomy)
   - TUI notification (low autonomy)
   - Solution proposal (medium autonomy)
   - Automatic fix with notification (high autonomy)
   - Preemptive correction (highest autonomy)

## Autonomy Levels

PostDevAI supports configurable autonomy levels:

- **Level 1: Observer** - Only monitors and logs issues, never intervenes
- **Level 2: Notifier** - Alerts you to issues but doesn't suggest fixes
- **Level 3: Advisor** - Suggests solutions but requires approval
- **Level 4: Assistant** - Implements simple fixes automatically, seeks approval for complex ones
- **Level 5: Pair Programmer** - Proactively implements fixes and improvements with minimal approval

Each level can be configured globally or per-project, allowing precise control over autonomy.

## Philosophy

Autonomy-Run represents a shift from tools as passive instruments to tools as active partners. It's not about replacing the developer, but rather:

- Eliminating repetitive tasks
- Reducing cognitive load
- Amplifying developer capabilities
- Preserving creative and strategic decisions
- Creating a "development exoskeleton" that enhances developer abilities

The ultimate goal is a system that feels like an extension of your mind - understanding your intentions, remembering your experiences, and handling the mechanical aspects of development while you focus on the creative and architectural elements.
